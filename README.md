This is my first project with GO!

Is a simple social media where you can create an account, post your feelings and follow other users.

To run it you have to use the SQL's scripts on a Postgres database and fill the .env file at the backend folder.

Then you run go build on the backend folder. To build the backend project.

Run go run main.go at the frontend folder and the project will run.

Thanks!
